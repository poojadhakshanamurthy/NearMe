 Arani has two main bus stations: the Arani Fort Bus Terminus, which is the central hub near the fort, and the Arani New Bus Station in Arani Palayam. While Arani Fort Bus Terminus is a major terminus, the Arani New Bus Station is currently closed, and there are ongoing discussions and plans for a new, integrated bus station to replace the existing facilities, which have been deemed inadequate.
